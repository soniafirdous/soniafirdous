# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on<br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with<br>🌱 I’m currently learning<br>💬 Ask me about<br>⚡ I am a Data Science student with hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Time Series Forecasting. I enjoy working on real-world problems and building end-to-end data science projects — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment.<br><br>I have worked extensively with Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, and built machine learning models such as Logistic Regression (One-vs-Rest), KNN, and classical regression models. In NLP, I have implemented text preprocessing pipelines, TF-IDF vectorization, tokenization, padding, and trained LSTM and Bi-LSTM models for sentiment analysis and text classification.<br><br>I have also explored Time Series Forecasting using SARIMA, Holt-Winters, LSTM, and Facebook Prophet, comparing traditional statistical approaches with deep learning models. For deployment, I use Streamlit to create interactive applications, and I am comfortable handling real deployment challenges such as pickle/dill model loading issues, dependency management, and environment debugging.
